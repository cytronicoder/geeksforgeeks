# GeeksforGeeks Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various coding problems and algorithmic challenges from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/).

Each solution is implemented in C++ and includes detailed explanations and (sometimes) code optimization tips.

The repository is organized based on difficulty. Feel free to explore the solutions, contribute, or use them as references for your own learning. Make sure to check out the `README` files in each folder for more detailed analysis and insights into how I solved each problem.

## Why?

I miss competitive programming.

Ever since I reached USACO Platinum, I've been focusing on other things like data science and machine learning. I want to get back into competitive programming, and I think GeeksforGeeks is a great place to start. I'm going to solve as many problems as I can and document my solutions here.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a better approach to solve a problem, create a pull request with your solution. Make sure to follow the repositoryâ€™s code style and guidelines. More information can be found [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).
