# Analysis

To solve this problem, we need to break down each element of the array into smaller parts such that each part is less than or equal to a given threshold value `k`. The goal is to count the total number of these smaller parts for all elements in the array.

## Insight

If we divide a number `x` into parts that are each at most `k`, the minimum number of such parts will be determined by `ceil(x / k)`.

We want to make sure that the integer division result is rounded up (equivalent to `ceil(x / k)`), which is necessary when dividing `x` into chunks of size `k` or smaller.

Therefore, we can calculate the number of parts for each element in the array using the formula: `parts = (x + k - 1) // k`.

## Approach and Checklist

1. Initialize `ans` counter to 0
2. For each element `x` in the array, calculate the number of parts using the aforementioned formula and add `parts` to `ans`
3. Return `ans` as final result

- [x] Single iteration through the array and constant-time operations to compute the parts count (`O(n)`)
- [x] No extra space is used other than a few integer variables (`O(1)`)
